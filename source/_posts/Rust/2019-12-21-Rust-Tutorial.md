## The Rust Programming Language

Recently, I have read [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) book which is really a comprehensive combination. I prefer to write some brief note when I am reading a book, just for times of reviews in the future. Here is the same. 

<!--more-->

I have split the book into 5 parts as below:

- Basic: contains chapter 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 18
- Manager: contains chapter 7, 14
- Style: contains chapter 13, 17
- Advance: contains chapter 15, 16, 19
- Project: contains chapter 2, 12, 20

Here are the links:

- [The Rust Programming Language Brief Note (Vol5-Project) | Yam](https://yam.gift/2019/12/03/Rust/RPL/2019-12-31-RPL-Brief-Note-Vol5-Project/)

And the code:

According to my experience, it's much easier and quicker to read again or find out the needed points I've already forgotten.

Rust itself is a low level programming language which always compared with cpp. But it seems more functional other than object oriented. Actually either style is ok, for more details, please read the `Style` part. I will talk more about Rust in the future.

I am an AI engineer, I have mainly focused on NLP in recent years. I like Rust, and I am preaching the programming language as possible as can. I believe Rust will be a nice tool in everyone's kit, and will lead the future.
